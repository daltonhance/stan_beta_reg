## Beta Regression in Stan

This is code to implement beta regression similar to the [`betareg` package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/betareg/index.html) in [Stan](http://mc-stan.org/).

## Simulated data

A minimal simulation model can be used to 

```{r, ggplot2}
library(betareg)
library(rstan)
library(dplyr)

N = 500
x1 = rnorm(N)
x2 = rnorm(N)
X = cbind(1, x1, x2)
beta = c(-1,.2,-.3)
mu = plogis(X%*%beta)  # add noise if desired + rnorm(N, sd=.01)
phi = 10
A = mu*phi
B = (1-mu)*phi
y = rbeta(N, A, B)
qplot(y, geom = "histogram", binwidth = .025)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
